# Bikesharing

For that we take the Newyork city bike sharing as a sample and analyse it if the business is promissing to invest on for our stakeholder. For this analysis we have used python and Tableau to analyse and viualize out project. The main question this project tries to answer is how the bike shsring in Newyork city behaves for the following combinations: 
 
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
