# Bikesharing

# Overview
The main purpose of this projet is to test if bike sharing investment is proffitable in the city of Des Monies. For that we take the Newyork city bike sharing as a sample and analyse it if the business is promissing to invest on for our stakeholder. For this analysis we have used python and Tableau to analyse and viualize out project. The main question this project tries to answer is how the bike shsring in Newyork city behaves for the following combinations: 
 
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Results
 - Bike trips by gender and duration
This is bike sharing by gender and duration of time bikeing.  As we can see on the image **male** users are by far larger than **female** users.However, both **male** and **female** uses bike for on average 20 minutes.
